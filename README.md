GYMLOCATOR

Aim

The main motive behind this project would be to have a utility that could show me where the nearest gyms are.
Anytime Fitness is a hugely successful global fitness franchise that prides itself on convenience. With over sixty outlets in Singapore, people who move around the city state on a regular basis would often have felt that a simple website or tool to find a nearby club would save them the trouble of entering their query into a search bar. 


UX
Having a single-page design with minimal clutter would allow this project to be mobile-friendly.
The dark mode interface map allows for a more easy-on-the-eye experience in this digital age, there are also two light modes, should the user feel the need to have a light-mode feature for easy-of-use under the flaring sunlight. 
Taking inspiration from the Anytime Fitness colours, the elements of the interface adn the iconic Running Man logo are in two-toned purple.
All features can be hidden away into a small menu button on the side of the screen, making the interface very easy to use on smaller devices.
