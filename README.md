# GYMLOCATOR
Anytime Fitness club address was taken from Anytime Fitness Singapore, coordinates were found on googlemaps. Data was then made in Microsoft Excel and saved as CSV UTF-8. CSV was converted to geoJSON using https://odileeds.github.io/CSV2GeoJSON/, which was created by Stuart Lowe, ODI Leeds 2020. (MIT Licence).

This cleared a major roadblock, as <geojson.io> was not able to read any CSV file from myself.
